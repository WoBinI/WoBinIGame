It can be used in the following ways:\n * - Specify the svgSrc input to load an SVG icon from a URL. The SVG content is directly inlined\n *   as a child of the <md-icon> component, so that CSS styles can easily be applied to it.\n *   The URL is loaded via an XMLHttpRequest, so it must be on the same domain as the page or its\n *   server must be configured to allow cross-domain requests.\n *   Example:\n *     <md-icon svgSrc=\"assets/arrow.svg\"></md-icon>\n *\n * - Specify the svgIcon input to load an SVG icon from a URL previously registered with the\n *   addSvgIcon, addSvgIconInNamespace, addSvgIconSet, or addSvgIconSetInNamespace methods of\n *   MdIconRegistry. If the svgIcon value contains a colon it is assumed to be in the format\n *   \"[namespace]:[name]\", if not the value will be the name of an icon in the default namespace.\n *   Examples:\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"left-arrow\"></md-icon>\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"animals:cat\"></md-icon>\n *\n * - Use a font ligature as an icon by putting the ligature text in the content of the <md-icon>\n *   component. By default the Material icons font is used as described at\n *   http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web. You can specify an\n *   alternate font by setting the fontSet input to either the CSS class to apply to use the\n *   desired font, or to an alias previously registered with MdIconRegistry.registerFontClassAlias.\n *   Examples:\n *     <md-icon>home</md-icon>\n *     <md-icon fontSet=\"myfont\">sun</md-icon>\n *\n * - Specify a font glyph to be included via CSS rules by setting the fontSet input to specify the\n *   font, and the fontIcon input to specify the icon. Typically the fontIcon will specify a\n *   CSS class which causes the glyph to be displayed via a :before selector, as in\n *   https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/\n *   Example:\n *     <md-icon fontSet=\"fa\" fontIcon=\"alarm\"></md-icon>\n */\nvar MdIcon = (function () {\n    function MdIcon(_elementRef, _renderer, _mdIconRegistry) {\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._mdIconRegistry = _mdIconRegistry;\n        /** Screenreader label for the icon. */\n        this.hostAriaLabel = '';\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(MdIcon.prototype, \"color\", {\n        /** Color of the icon. */\n        get: function () { return this._color; },\n        set: function (value) { this._updateColor(value); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    MdIcon.prototype._updateColor = function (newColor) {\n        this._setElementColor(this._color, false);\n        this._setElementColor(newColor, true);\n        this._color = newColor;\n    };\n    MdIcon.prototype._setElementColor = function (color, isAdd) {\n        if (color != null && color != '') {\n            this._renderer.setElementClass(this._elementRef.nativeElement, \"md-\" + color, isAdd);\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * Splits an svgIcon binding value into its icon set and icon name components.\n     * Returns a 2-element array of [(icon set), (icon name)].\n     * The separator for the two fields is ':'.

For example, if one of the controls in a group is invalid, the entire\n      * group becomes invalid.\n      * *\n      * `FormGroup` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n      * along with {@link FormControl} and {@link FormArray}.\n      * *\n      * *\n      * When instantiating a {@link FormGroup}, pass in a collection of child controls as the first\n      * argument. The key for each child will be the name under which it is registered.\n      * *\n      * ### Example\n      * *\n      * ```\n      * const form = new FormGroup({\n      * first: new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),\n      * last: new FormControl('Drew'),\n      * });\n      * *\n      * console.log(form.value);   // {first: 'Nancy', last; 'Drew'}\n      * console.log(form.status);  // 'VALID'\n      * ```\n      * *\n      * You can also include group-level validators as the second arg, or group-level async\n      * validators as the third arg.

Form arrays allow you to create new\n      * form controls dynamically.\n      * *\n      * **Access the array**: You can access the associated {@link FormArray} using the\n      * {@link AbstractControl.get} method on the parent {@link FormGroup}.\n      * Ex: `this.form.get('cities')`.\n      * *\n      * **Get the value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the\n      * {@link FormArray}. See a full list of available properties in {@link AbstractControl}.\n      * *\n      * **Set the value**: You can set an initial value for each child control when instantiating\n      * the {@link FormArray}, or you can set the value programmatically later using the\n      * {@link FormArray}'s {@link AbstractControl.setValue} or {@link AbstractControl.patchValue}\n      * methods.\n      * *\n      * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the array, you can\n      * subscribe to the {@link FormArray}'s {@link AbstractControl.valueChanges} event.  You can also\n      * listen to its {@link AbstractControl.statusChanges} event to be notified when the validation\n      * status is re-calculated.\n      * *\n      * **Add new controls**: You can add new controls to the {@link FormArray} dynamically by\n      * calling its {@link FormArray.push} method.\n      * Ex: `this.form.get('cities').push(new FormControl());`\n      * *\n      * ### Example\n      * *\n      * {@example forms/ts/nestedFormArray/nested_form_array_example.ts region='Component'}\n      * *\n      * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n      * *\n      * * **NgModule**: `ReactiveFormsModule`\n      * *\n     */\n    var FormArrayName = (function (_super) {\n        __extends$12(FormArrayName, _super);\n        /**\n         * @param {?} parent\n         * @param {?} validators\n         * @param {?} asyncValidators\n         */\n        function FormArrayName(parent, validators, asyncValidators) {\n            _super.call(this);\n            this._parent = parent;\n            this._validators = validators;\n            this._asyncValidators = asyncValidators;\n        }\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        FormArrayName.prototype.ngOnInit = function () {\n            this._checkParentType();\n            this.formDirective.addFormArray(this);\n        };\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        FormArrayName.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () {\n            if (this.formDirective) {\n                this.formDirective.removeFormArray(this);\n            }\n        };\n        Object.defineProperty(FormArrayName.prototype, \"control\", {\n            /**\n             * @return {?}\n             */\n            get: function () { return this.formDirective.getFormArray(this); },\n            enumerable: true,\n            configurable: true\n        });\n        Object.defineProperty(FormArrayName.prototype, \"formDirective\", {\n            /**\n             * @return {?}\n             */\n            get: function () {\n                return this._parent ?
